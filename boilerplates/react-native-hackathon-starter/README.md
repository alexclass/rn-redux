## Update (May '17)

This library has been moved into [React Native Elements](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements) repo under `/example` folder.

We have reimplemented the entire app from scratch using [Expo](https://expo.io/) & [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) and also updated it to include all the latest component for RNE.

- Here's the link to the app: https://expo.io/@monte9/react-native-elements-app

- Also here's the new home for this repo: https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/tree/master/example
